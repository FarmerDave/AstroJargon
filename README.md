AstroJargon Mask Generator (Bahtinov and others)

This is a rewrite/conversion of the Bahtinov mask generator from the (currently) defunct website astrojargon.net.  

A Bahtinov mask is a focusing aid for astronomers (in general) and astrophotographers (in particular).  It consists of a disk made of (usually) opaque material fitted over the telescope objective with slots cut out in a specific pattern devised by amateur astrophotographer Pavel Bahtinov. For more information, look at [this thread on CloudyNights](http://www.cloudynights.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/2544487/page/0/view/collapsed/sb/5/o/all/fpart/1/vc/1) or here at [Spike-a.com](http://www.spike-a.com/).

Designing a mask using drawing, design, or CAD software can be challenging, as the specifics of the mask change for each telescope based on aperture, focal length, and how you plan to attach the mask to the scope. This generator makes producing masks significantly easier - simply enter values specific to your telescope, and it generates SVG and displays an image with your design.
