### Bahtinov Mask Generator

Looking for the online Bahtinov Mask Generator?  The original online mask generator is no more, but has been completely rewritten as a Windows app, called the AstroJargon Mask Generator.  The Windows version does Bahtinov masks, Tri-Bahtinov masks, Hartmann masks, Scheiner Disks, Carey masks, Couder masks, and more.
